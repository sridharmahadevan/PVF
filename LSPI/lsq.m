% [w, A, b] = lsq(samples, policy, new_policy)
%
% Evaluates the "policy" using the set of "samples", that is, it
% learns a set of weights for the basis specified in new_policy to
% form the approximate Q-value of the "policy" and the improved
% "new_policy". The approximation is the fixed point of the Bellman
% equation.
%
% Returns the learned weights w and the matrices A and b of the
% linear system Aw=b. 
%
% See also lsqfast.m for a faster (batch) implementation.
